## Introduction

Welcome to the "R Package for Hypothesis Testing" GitHub repository! This project showcases an advanced R package designed to simplify and enhance hypothesis testing procedures. Leveraging advanced R programming techniques, including functional programming and function factories, this package provides researchers and data analysts with a robust tool for conducting hypothesis tests.

## Project Highlights

- **Constructor Function**: We've created a powerful constructor function capable of analyzing two data samples, whether they are paired or independent. This function employs t-test theory and considers essential factors such as population variances. It delivers clear "Y/N" conclusions regarding the equality of means at specified alpha levels, assisting researchers in making data-informed decisions.

- **Structured Output**: Our project places a strong emphasis on presenting the results of statistical tests in a structured and easily interpretable format. You can expect detailed summary statistics that offer deeper insights into data distributions and statistical significance.

- **GitHub Repository**: Access the package code on the author's GitHub account. Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback.

- **Interactive Shiny App**: To demonstrate the package's practical application in real-world scenarios, we've developed an interactive Shiny app. See how our package can streamline hypothesis testing in your data analysis projects.
