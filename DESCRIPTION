Description: The packages is built for conducting t test analysis, and it will 
             test the NULL hypothesis that the underlying means of the two 
             populations are the same. The package has a constructor fuction a
             print function, and a plot function. Both of these functions , 
             print and plot are used so that ultimately we print the relevant 
             information of t tests results  and get boxplots of the data.
